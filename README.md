## Project Overview

Guess the Image is an interactive website where users can upload images, and the application will predict the class of the image based on a model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for image upload
- Real-time image classification
- Display of prediction results with confidence scores

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-image.git
   cd guess-the-image

2. Install dependencies:
   "pip install -r requirements.txt"

3. Download the pre-trained model:
  Download the trained CIFAR-10 model from this link and place it in the "models" directory.

4. Run the application:
  "python app.py"

5. Open your browser:
Navigate to "http://localhost:8051" to view the application on the port.

## Usage

1.Open the web application in your browser.

2.Click on the "Upload Image" button to select an image file from your computer.

3.Wait for the model to classify the image.

4.View the prediction results displayed on the screen.

I've made the following changes:

1. Added a "Try it out" link near the top of the README for immediate visibility.
2. Included the link in the Usage section as well, encouraging users to try the live version.

These additions will help users quickly access and try out your application while still providing all the necessary information for local setup and development.
